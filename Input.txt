# When adding a new intersection the name of the point is supplied
# All adjacent nodes to it must follow immediately with the 'neighbor' keyword
# A neighbor can be referenced either by giving its name, which must match the
# corresponding nodes name exactly, or by giving a value indicated by its order
# given. Each neighbor must also contain the time value between the nodes.
# All time is denoted in [seconds]
# 
# intersect a
# neighbor b 15
# neighbor [3] 15   -> denotes the third node, c
#
# intersect b
#intersect c
